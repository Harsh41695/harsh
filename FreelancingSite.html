<font Color = "green" size="6%">Upwork</font> <font size="5%">is a freelancing website that connects clients and freelancers from across the globe. <br ><br>
The platform provides a wide range of categories, from web design and software development to customer service and accounting.<br> <br>

Clients and freelancers have multiple ways to connect – clients can choose to post a job and hire talent or buy a predefined service from the 
<a href = "https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/best-freelance-websites/ "> project catalog</a>. Similarly, freelancers can access the job board and offer a service to sell.<br> <br>

To get started as a freelancer with Upwork, begin by creating a profile. Ensure it includes details about yourself, your expertise, and your work experience.

 Keep in mind that clients will decide whether you’re qualified by scanning through your profile whenever you bid for jobs or pitch a project.<br> <br>

Upwork has a sliding scale, meaning the more you work, the less money you pay. For example, the commission fee starts from 20% for the first bill of 
<b>$500</b> and gradually reduces as you receive more money.<br> <br>

There are several options for withdrawal, including direct transfer, PayPal, and wire transfer. <br> <br>
